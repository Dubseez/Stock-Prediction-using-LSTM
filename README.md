# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM

The Stock Price Prediction project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict future stock prices based on historical market data. LSTM is ideal for this task due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
